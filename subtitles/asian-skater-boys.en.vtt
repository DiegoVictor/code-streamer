00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.360 line:15
For us, there is a lack
of representation

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.400 line:15
of Asians in all areas,
especially skateboarding.

3
00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:10.685 line:15
'We created a
collective to make

4
00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:13.245 line:15
Asian skaters more visible'

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.160 line:15
My name is Thomas Pham,
I'm 24 years old,

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.400 line:15
and I'm part of the
Bassac collective.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.096 line:15
My name is Thien Thanh,
I'm 23 years old

8
00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:21.679 line:15
and I've been part

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200 line:15
of the Bassac collective
since the beginning.

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.319 line:15
Bassac is a skateboarding
collective

11
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200 line:15
that aims to promote

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.640 line:15
the 13th district and
the Asian community.

13
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.920 line:15
We have an Instagram
account where we publish

14
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.880 line:15
photos, videos,
skateboarding edits.

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.879 line:15
We are trying to put

16
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.620 line:15
some references to
our identity and culture.

17
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.080 line:15
We do this through music

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280 line:15
and images of our
neighbourhood.

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600 line:15
I started skating
eight years ago.

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.280 line:15
At first, I did it
on my own.

21
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.880 line:15
Then, I made some friends
who are now part of Bassac.

22
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.520 line:15
I feel like it's a family.

23
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.480 line:15
Honestly, it has become
like a little ritual,

24
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.480 line:15
on weekends,
we get together,

25
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.240 line:15
we talk, skate
and laugh together.

26
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360 line:15
Here we are on the slab

27
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.280 line:15
"Olympiad", it is like the
heart of the 13th district.

28
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.960 line:15
I'd say it's the Chinatown
of Paris.

29
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.760 line:15
It's a neighbourhood with

30
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.080 line:15
a lot of Southeast Asian
people, mostly.

31
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.840 line:15
There are lots

32
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.000 line:15
of restaurants and
plenty of shops.

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.280 line:15
The name Bassac
comes from a junction

34
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.840 line:15
of the Mekong river, we
thought it sounded good

35
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.920 line:15
and that it represented
our identities well.

36
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.840 line:15
In the collective,

37
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.440 line:15
we have people who have
Vietnamese,

38
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.801 line:15
Cambodian and Chaochow
origins.

39
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.440 line:15
These are minorities
that are not

40
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.283 line:15
necessarily represented

41
00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:36.640 line:15
in the "mainstream"
Asian culture,

42
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.296 line:15
where we usually just see
Koreans, Japanese, etc.

43
00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:42.520 line:15
In the community,

44
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.600 line:15
skating is a discipline
with a bad reputation.

45
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.200 line:15
Bassac is simply the desire
to make skating more

46
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.880 line:15
accessible for Asians,
for our community.

47
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.040 line:15
I think it's a shame
that people hesitate

48
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.560 line:15
to get involved because of

49
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.280 line:15
where they're from when
in fact, skating

50
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.999 line:15
is a very friendly sport

51
00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:00.960 line:15
that does not
take into account

52
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.760 line:15
our person or
our ethnic background.

53
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.200 line:15
The goal is really
to encourage people

54
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.680 line:15
who otherwise wouldn't
dare to take the plunge.
